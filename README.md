## Used libraries

`d3` from https://d3js.org/ - lovely visual library

`axios` from https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios as data fetcher (however, after some minor issues decided to use standard fetch)

The program is simple. 
First, I fetched the data from open API, then mapped and sorted it.
After that, I plotted the graph of CZK (Czech crown) to EUR (Euro).
